# Human Resources Application


### Overview

For my graduation thesis, I spent six months planning, writing, and implementing a Human Resources application designed for Faustica, a family-owned farming company with over 50 employees based in San Carlos, Costa Rica. Before this project, it took their one-person Human Resources team a full day to calculate payroll by hand. This app automates that effort in mere minutes and fully complies with Costa Rican labor laws.

* **User Management:** Handle employees' details and records.

* **Payroll Automation:** Calculate and process payroll based on hours worked.
